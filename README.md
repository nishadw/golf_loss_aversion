ABSTRACT:

Loss-aversion is a type of conservative mindset that can negatively impact performance. In this study, we systematically surveyed a pool of golfers. We then analyzed, in detail, the relationships among participantsâ€™ attributes and the degree of loss-aversion. Based on these findings, we propose how to develop effective campaigns to help individuals or teams overcome their loss-aversion.
